Soil Fertility Prediction
Overview
This Jupyter Notebook repository explores soil fertility prediction using various machine learning models. Leveraging a comprehensive soil fertility dataset, the notebook demonstrates the implementation and training of models such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression, Random Forest (RF) classifier, Decision Tree, and Artificial Neural Network (ANN).

Key Features
Diverse Models: SVM, KNN, Logistic Regression, RF, Decision Tree, and ANN models are implemented and trained within a Jupyter Notebook environment.
Dataset: The project utilizes a robust soil fertility dataset for training and evaluation.
Step-by-Step Implementation: The notebook provides a clear, step-by-step walkthrough of each model's implementation, training, and evaluation.
Model Accuracies
SVM Accuracy: 84%
KNN Accuracy: 72%
Logistic Regression Accuracy: 83%
Random Forest Accuracy: 88%
Decision Tree Accuracy: 83%
ANN Accuracy: 84%
